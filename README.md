# URL Abuse

URL Abuse is a versatile free software for URL review, analysis and black-list reporting. URL Abuse is composed of a web interface where requests are submitted asynchronously and a back-end system to process the URLs into features modules.

## Features

 - HTTP redirects analysis and follows
 - [Google Safe-Browsing](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/) lookup

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests for new extensions, bug fixes.

### Add a new module

Look at the existings functions/modules. The changes will have to be made in the following files:

* Add the function you want to execure in url\_abuse\_async.py
* Add a route in web/\_\_init\_\_.py. This route will do an async call to the function defined in url\_abuse\_async.py. The parameter of the function is sent in an POST object
* Add a statement in web/templates/url-report.html. The data option is the parameter to pass to the javascript directive
* Add a directive in web/static/main.js, it will take care of passing the parameter to the backend and regularly pull for the response of the async call
